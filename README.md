# Tapestry

**Tapestry** is a full stack web application that generates prose to add life to, and provide inspiration for, anyone playing or running fantasy tabletop RPGs - primarily Dungeons & Dragons. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 text generator to generate original texts, and all generated texts are saved to a database, providing an ever-expanding library of material.

## Design

The application is fully responsive for all screen sizes. The visual design was implemented using [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

The primary functionality of the application was planned in Figma, a sample of which is shown below. The full version of the initial flowchart be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XtbHPUghd4wbZKq7x73yVV/tapestry?node-id=0%3A1&t=4QTNe0RWf4jwAzgN-1) - please note that this does not represent the final product, as the design evolved somewhat during the development process.

The database schema to support this functionality was designed in DrawSQL. This also no longer represents the current state of the project, due to improvements made since.
