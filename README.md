**Tapestry** is a full stack web application that generates prose to add life to, and provide inspiration for, anyone playing or running fantasy tabletop RPGs - primarily Dungeons & Dragons. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 text generator to generate original texts, and all generated texts are saved to a database, providing an ever-expanding library of material.

## Design

The application is fully responsive for all screen sizes. The visual design was implemented using [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

The primary functionality of the application was planned in Figma & DrawSQL. The full version of the initial flowchart be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XtbHPUghd4wbZKq7x73yVV/tapestry?node-id=0%3A1&t=4QTNe0RWf4jwAzgN-1) Please note that these diagrams do not represent the final product, as improvements were made to the design during the development process.

## Functionality

- Generate original names/backstories/settlement descriptions supported by OpenAI's GPT-3 text generator, or retrieve texts that were previously generated by others
- Generating original texts costs credits; each account has a finite number
- Generated character names are embedded in backstories and can be changed prior to saving
- Any generated item can be saved to the user's profile for future reference
- User authorisation and authentication
- Fully responsive & functional on any standard device size
